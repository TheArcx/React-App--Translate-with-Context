# React App: Translate with Context
 Simple application that switches from dutch to english and vice versa. Used to learn a basic implementation of Context
 
The application can be started by running 'npm start' in the command line. Once at localhost:3000 the user can select either flag to change the language of the form title and submit button using React Context.

% To Do %
- add further implementation on form submission ie: pop up another window or another text box below to display the translated language
